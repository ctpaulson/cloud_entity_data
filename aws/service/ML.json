These tools build forecasts by looking at a historical series of data, which is called time series data. For example, such tools may try to predict the future sales of a raincoat by looking only at its previous sales data with the underlying assumption that the future is determined by the past. This approach can struggle to produce accurate forecasts for large sets of data that have irregular trends. Also, it fails to easily combine data series that change over time (such as price, discounts, web traffic, and number of employees) with relevant independent variables such as product features and store locations.\nBased on the same technology used at Amazon.com, Amazon Forecast uses ML to combine time series data with additional variables to build forecasts. Amazon Forecast requires no ML experience to get started. You only need to provide historical data, plus any additional data that you believe may impact your forecasts. For example, the demand for a particular color of a shirt may change with the seasons and store location. This complex relationship is hard to determine on its own, but ML is ideally suited to recognize it. Once you provide your data, Amazon Forecast will automatically examine it, identify what is meaningful, and produce a forecasting model capable of making predictions that are up to 50% more accurate than looking at time series data alone.\nAmazon Forecast is a fully managed service, so there are no servers to provision, and no ML models to build, train, or deploy.

RL is an advanced ML technique which takes a very different approach to training models than other ML methods. Its superpower is that it learns very complex behaviors without requiring any labeled training data, and can make short term decisions while optimizing for a longer term goal.\nWith AWS DeepRacer, you now have a way to get hands-on with RL, experiment, and learn through autonomous driving. You can get started with the virtual car and tracks in the cloud-based 3D racing simulator, and for a real-world experience, you can deploy your trained models onto AWS DeepRacer and race your friends, or take part in the global AWS DeepRacer League.

With AWS Panorama, you can automate tasks that have traditionally required human inspection to improve visibility into potential issues. Computer vision can automate visual inspection for tasks such as tracking assets to optimize supply chain operations, monitoring traffic lanes to optimize traffic management, or detecting anomalies to evaluate manufacturing quality. In environments with limited network bandwidth however, or for companies with data governance rules that require on-premises processing and storage of video, computer vision in the cloud can be difficult or impossible to implement.\nAWS Panorama is an ML service that allows organizations to bring computer vision to on-premises cameras to make predictions locally with high accuracy and low latency.\nThe AWS Panorama Appliance is a hardware device that adds computer vision to your existing IP cameras and analyzes the video feeds of multiple cameras from a single management interface. It generates predictions at the edge in milliseconds, meaning you can be notified about potential issues such as when damaged products are detected on a fast-moving production line, or when a vehicle has strayed into a dangerous off-limits zone in a warehouse. And, third-party manufacturers are building new AWS Panorama-enabled cameras and devices to provide even more form factors for your unique use cases. With AWS Panorama you can use ML models from AWS to build your own computer vision applications, or work with a partner from the AWS Partner Network to build CV applications quickly.",
