Amazon Detective automatically collects log data from your AWS resources and uses machine learning, statistical analysis, and graph theory to build a linked set of data that enables you to easily conduct faster and more efficient security investigations. Amazon Detective further simplifies account management for security operations and investigations across all existing and future accounts in an organization using AWS Organizations for up to 1,200 AWS accounts.\nAWS security services such as Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Macie, and AWS Security Hub, as well as partner security products, can be used to identify potential security issues, or findings. These services are really helpful in alerting you when and where there is possible unauthorized access or suspicious behavior in your AWS deployment. However, sometimes there are security findings that you would like to perform deeper investigations of the events that led to the findings to remediate the root cause. Determining the root cause of security findings can be a complex process for security analysts that often involves collecting and combining logs from many data sources, using extract, transform, and load (ETL) tools, and custom scripting to organize the data.\nAmazon Detective simplifies this process by enabling your security teams to easily investigate and quickly get to the root cause of a finding. Detective can analyze trillions of events from multiple data sources such as Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon GuardDuty. Detective uses these events to automatically create a unified, interactive view of your resources, users, and the interactions between them over time. With this unified view, you can visualize all the details and context in one place to identify the underlying reasons for the findings, drill down into relevant historical activities, and quickly determine the root cause.\nYou can get started with Amazon Detective in just a few clicks in the AWS Management Console. There is no software to deploy, or data sources to enable and maintain. You can try Detective at no additional charge with a 30-day free trial that is available to new accounts.",

GuardDuty identifies suspected attackers through integrated threat intelligence feeds and machine learning anomaly detection to detect anomalies in account and workload activity. When potential unauthorized use is detected, the service delivers a detailed finding to the GuardDuty console, Amazon CloudWatch Events, and AWS Security Hub. This makes findings actionable and easy to integrate into existing event management and workflow systems. Further investigation to determine the root cause of a finding is easily accomplished by using Amazon Detective directly from the GuardDuty console.\nAmazon GuardDuty is cost effective and easy to operate. It does not require you to deploy and maintain software or security infrastructure, meaning it can be enabled quickly with no risk of negatively impacting existing application and container workloads. There are no upfront costs with GuardDuty, no software to deploy, and no threat intelligence feeds to enable.

For example, the new Amazon Inspector calculates a highly contextualized risk score for each finding by correlating common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) information with factors such as network access and exploitability. This score is used to prioritize the most critical vulnerabilities to improve remediation response efficiency. Additionally, Amazon Inspector now uses the widely deployed AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) to eliminate the need for you to deploy and maintain a standalone agent to run Amazon EC2 instance assessments. For container workloads, Amazon Inspector is now integrated with Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) to support intelligent, cost-efficient, and continual vulnerability assessments of container images.

In addition to the network and transport layer protections that come with Standard, AWS Shield Advanced provides additional detection and mitigation against large and sophisticated DDoS attacks, near real-time visibility into attacks, and integration with AWS WAF, a web application firewall. AWS Shield Advanced also gives you 24x7 access to the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT) and protection against DDoS related spikes in your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, and Amazon Route 53 charges.\nAWS Shield Advanced is available globally on all Amazon CloudFront and Amazon Route 53 edge locations. You can protect your web applications hosted anywhere in the world by deploying Amazon CloudFront in front of your application. Your origin servers can be Amazon S3, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), or a custom server outside of AWS.

AWS WAF gives you control over how traffic reaches your applications by enabling you to create security rules that control bot traffic and block common attack patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting. You can also customize rules that filter out specific traffic patterns. You can get started quickly using Managed Rules for AWS WAF, a pre-configured set of rules managed by AWS or AWS Marketplace sellers to address issues like the OWASP Top 10 security risks and automated bots that consume excess resources, skew metrics, or can cause downtime. These rules are regularly updated as new issues emerge. AWS WAF includes a full-featured API that you can use to automate the creation, deployment, and maintenance of security rules.",

You can also require WAF Captcha challenges for suspicious requests based on the rate, attributes, or labels generated from AWS Managed Rules, such as AWS WAF Bot Control or the Amazon IP Reputation list. WAF Captcha challenges are simple for humans while remaining effective against bots.
